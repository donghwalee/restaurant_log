# Project Four - Ruby on Rails / Angular Application

## This is a simple restaurant logging app utilizing Ruby on Rails and Angular

## Simplified flow for app:
- User can log in or register
- Once registered and logged in, they are shown a page with their previous restaurant logs
- The user is able to enter new restaurant logs, the page uses Angular so it does not need to refresh to show the new entry
- The user is able to log out

## Future additions:
- Full CRUD (including update and delete capabilities).
- Ability to sort by different fields, ratings, dates, etc.
- Different types of restaurant (French, American, etc.)
- Integration with other relevant APIs, Google Maps, Yelp, reservation, ordering, etc.
- Ability to share or have others see your entries
- Ability to upload / add images, etc.
- Additional model to log additional instances of going to the same restaurant
